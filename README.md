## Resources
- [crypto_data.csv](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/all/coinlist)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, hvplot, plotly, sklearn

## Overview

1- The above dataset was cleaned and preprocessed in order to perform PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
2- The resulting dataframe was reduced to 3 dimensions using PCA.
3- K-Means analysis was performed using the PCA data to determine the number of clusters and create a prediction model.
4- Visualizations were created to show the clustering in 3D, a table sortable by feature, and a scatterplot of coin supply vs coins mined.
